### 1.3.0 AI relase
We‚Äôre introducing a daily evolving world logic system to CRRP‚Äôs server core. This module allows the game world to shift each day based on narrative progression, without requiring admin input.

üìå Core Functionality:
	‚Ä¢	üîÅ Automated World Progression based on story arc (INIT ‚Üí OP_BLACKLINE ‚Üí LOCKDOWN)
	‚Ä¢	üõ∞Ô∏è Northbridge Propaganda Broadcasts: Daily-generated safety notices, curfews, and misinformation spread across terminals and text files
	‚Ä¢	üìª Resistance Radio Drops: Secret messages, meeting points, and encoded broadcasts accessible to those listening
	‚Ä¢	üß† AI-driven future roadmap for generating new broadcasts dynamically and adjusting world logic in response to player decisions

üß™ Dev Notes:
	‚Ä¢	JSON state stored internally, rotated per server restart/day
	‚Ä¢	FiveM-native file operations (using LoadResourceFile & SaveResourceFile)
	‚Ä¢	Modular system built for easy expansion (e.g., faction-specific events, fake intel drops, player-impact triggers)
