## üß™ Testing & Development

> **üìñ For comprehensive testing procedures, see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)**

### Quick Test Commands

```lua
-- Server console testing
TriggerEvent('crp-reckoning:tunnel:debugAccess', playerId, tunnelId)
TriggerEvent('crp-reckoning:blackline:triggerEvent', playerId, 'interrogation')
TriggerEvent('crp-reckoning:radio:testBroadcast', 'Test message')
```

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```lua
Config.Debug = true  -- In config.lua
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Admin Panel Won't Load:** Check resource files and fxmanifest.lua
2. **Database Connection Errors:** Verify oxmysql configuration
3. **Authentication Fails:** Check QBCore permissions and player ID
4. **NPCs not spawning:** Check max NPC limit in config
5. **Radio not working:** Verify pma-voice integration
6. **Tunnel effects not applying:** Check QBCore player data access
7. **Discord webhooks failing:** Verify webhook URLs and rate limits

### Performance Issues

- Monitor memory usage with debug mode
- Adjust update intervals for lower-end servers
- Reduce max active events/NPCs if needed
- Use database cleanup procedures regularly
